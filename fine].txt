										ITS FINE

one day i said things which i never wanted to ,
thought that you will hate me even if u dont want to,


i messed things up
u said its ok
i thought we might end up
but my demon dont care
gonna write things up
thinking all ok
it stared to break my heart 
i said i dont care


she said its fine   
 to think she is fine
feeling so high 
 cuz now our mine
my friends werent right
 they said they are right
i said i like you 
 but u said its fine
yeah its fine
yeah its fine
yeah its fine
but u said its fine even if it wasnt right
